sunriseTime and sunsetTime (only defined on daily data points)

summary: A human-readable text summary of this data point. (Do not use this value for automated purposes: you should use the icon property, instead.)
icon: A machine-readable text summary of this data point, suitable for selecting an icon for display. If defined, this property will have one of the following values: clear-day, clear-night, rain, snow, sleet, wind, fog, cloudy, partly-cloudy-day, or partly-cloudy-night. (Developers should ensure that a sensible default is defined, as additional values, such as hail, thunderstorm, or tornado, may be defined in the future.)
sunriseTime and sunsetTime (only defined on daily data points): The UNIX time (that is, seconds since midnight GMT on 1 Jan 1970) of the last sunrise before and first sunset after the solar noon closest to local noon on the given day. (Note: near the poles, these may occur on a different day entirely!)
moonPhase (only defined on daily data points): A number representing the fractional part of the lunation number of the given day: a value of 0 corresponds to a new moon, 0.25 to a first quarter moon, 0.5 to a full moon, and 0.75 to a last quarter moon. (The ranges in between these represent waxing crescent, waxing gibbous, waning gibbous, and waning crescent moons, respectively.)

precipProbability: A numerical value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the probability of precipitation occurring at the given time.

temperatureMin, temperatureMinTime, temperatureMax, and temperatureMaxTime (only defined on daily data points): numerical values representing the minimum and maximumum temperatures (and the UNIX times at which they occur) on the given day in degrees Fahrenheit.


temperature (not defined on daily data points): A numerical value representing the temperature at the given time in degrees Fahrenheit.



cloudCover: A numerical value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the percentage of sky occluded by clouds.


humidity: A numerical value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the relative humidity.

visibility: A numerical value representing the average visibility in miles, capped at 10 miles.
